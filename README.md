## Features

### Audio Ingestion & Processing

- Continuous import from Apple Voice Memos, Google Drive, and local folders.
- Automated pipeline: VAD → Transcription → Conversation extraction →
  Summarization.
- Smart chunking, waveform normalization, and diarization-friendly segments.
- Whisper transcription via local GPU or any remote OpenAI-compatible server.
- Audio recording, playback (0.5x–3x speed, volume up to 300%), and WAV export.
- Pipeline monitoring UI with real-time session tracking and error handling.

### Interactive Timeline

- D3.js-powered multi-track timeline with zoom and pan.
- Multi-resolution views (5 min, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).
- Transcript-synced audio playback with jump controls.
- Track visibility controls, object overlays, and event creation from selection.
- Persisted object-density bars at far zoom; individual object intervals load
  only when the scale is detailed enough.
- Quick presets (last hour, today, yesterday, this week, and more).

### Location Tracks & Map

- Preview and safely import overlapping GPS tracks (GPX, KML/KMZ), keeping
  provenance, every source coordinate, named routes and full non-geometry KMZ
  metadata without turning bookmark timestamps into false whereabouts. Each
  import keeps a detailed file passport and separates coordinate/metadata
  differences for review.
- Opt-in Locations row on the timeline: stays with city labels, movements, and
  grey "assumed" gaps; click a band to see where it was on a mini-map.
- Dedicated Map page: movements over any period with automatic simplification,
  dwell-time-sized stay circles, saved places/source tracks, coordinate review,
  and conversation clusters you can browse.
- Fully offline reverse geocoding (GeoNames) and automatic timezone periods
  derived from your movements; manual location assignment for ranges without
  data. See [LOCATIONS.md](docs/LOCATIONS.md) for the full manual.

### AI Chat

- Chat with your memory using a curated tool catalogue, with Auto, No tools, and
  per-chat Custom policies; data-changing actions require explicit approval.
- Streaming responses with durable run status, observable tool activity and
  usage metadata, retry/stop controls, and in-app completion notifications.
- Searchable chat history with favorites and a separate archive, compact
  message/pin counts, actual-model labels, unread states, resizable navigation,
  rename, and previous/next navigation across pinned messages.

### Object Management

- Create, edit, and browse People, Events, Conversations, Relationships, and
  Promises.
- Per-object audio player with transcript sync and segment navigation.
- LLM summarization with model selection and cost estimation.
- Summary comparison (side-by-side, star/favorite).
- Autosave with per-field throttling and version history.
- Full-text search, category filtering, and relationship graph.
- Lazy, cursor-paginated object sections with bounded backend queries and
  independent cached count freshness.

### Background Processing

- BullMQ job queue backed by Redis.
- Canonical worker catalog shared by Jobs and Settings, with stable stale-state
  fallback, one-line descriptions, relevant routing metadata, and compact
  advanced controls.
- Persistent manual snapshots for exact backlog, incremental run history, and
  Timeline integrity; refresh failures retain the last successful values.
- Durable, pausable Timeline density rebuild campaigns with bounded batches,
  progress, missing-successor recovery, and explicit final verification.
- Lightweight live diarization campaign, five-minute rolling throughput, queue,
  and dynamic route-capacity status, with corpus-wide pipeline and identity
  counts available through explicit calculate buttons instead of dashboard
  polling.
- Pipeline ordering and progress tracking.
- Configurable worker defaults and prompt templates.
- Failed-job bulk retry, obsolete-failure dismissal, VAD queue recovery, and
  historical conversation repair:
  [pipeline troubleshooting](docs/CONVERSATION_EXTRACTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Infrastructure & Auth

- One-command Docker setup (`docker compose up -d`) with backend, frontend,
  Python worker, MongoDB, and Redis.
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, `.well-known` metadata, JWT login, and API key
  management.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server endpoint for remote operations and
  scripting.
- First-run setup wizard with automatic API key creation and inference provider
  configuration.
- OpenTelemetry observability (optional).
- Feature flags, access logging, and server configuration UI.

### Integrations

- Messenger platform import (Telegram, Signal).
- LLM provider configuration with model aliases (small / medium / large),
  independent host/catalog checks, and fixed or automatic live-model selection.
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`,
  `/llm/chat/completions`).
- MongoDB full-text search alongside GridFS-backed storage.

## Roadmap

**In progress**

- Friend-Lite companion app + advanced backend (`friend/`) wiring semantic
  memories and wearable capture back into Mycelia.
- GPU diarization stack replacing the current batch-only flow (`diarizator/`
  Helm charts + WebUI).
- Semantic search + vector memory integration connecting Qdrant-backed pipelines
  and the OpenMemory MCP bridges into the main timeline.

**Planned**

- Multi-device & multi-modal capture (health, geolocation, photos, sensors).
- Privacy + usage dashboards, token metering, and export flows.
- Processing / artifact templates, batch operations, and backup automation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose

### Setup & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mycelia-tech/mycelia.git
cd mycelia

./scripts/setup.sh --start
```

The setup script automatically:

- Creates `.env` from `.env.example`
- Generates a secure `SECRET_KEY`
- Starts all services with Docker Compose

Open [http://localhost:3210](http://localhost:3210) in your browser.

#### CLI/Python Daemon Users

If you need API tokens in `.env` (for Python daemon or CLI access):

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh --with-tokens --start
```

This starts MongoDB temporarily to generate `MYCELIA_CLIENT_ID` and
`MYCELIA_TOKEN`.

#### Checking and Syncing After Updates

After pulling updates, check whether `.env` still matches `.env.example`. The
checker reports only key names and line numbers; it never prints values:

```bash
./scripts/check-env.sh --all    # Audit every configured env contract
./scripts/check-env.sh          # Audit only the root .env
./scripts/check-env.sh --strict # Also warn about blank active values
./scripts/check-env.sh --fix    # Back up .env and apply safe fixes
./scripts/sync-env.sh           # Interactive - prompts before adding
./scripts/sync-env.sh --dry-run # Preview changes without modifying
```

The main stack, standalone diarizator, and remote GPU stack intentionally use
separate templates. `--all` checks `.env`, `diarizator/.env`, and `gpu/.env`
when present; an absent optional deployment is reported as not configured.
Use `--fix --prune-undocumented` only after reviewing the listed key names: it
backs up the selected file and removes keys that its template no longer owns.

> **Note**: For local development, Mycelia uses a self-signed certificate. You
> may need to click "Advanced" and "Proceed" in your browser. See
> [NETWORKING.md](docs/NETWORKING.md) for more details on port configuration and
> SSL.

### Import Existing Audio Files

The Python daemon discovers new recordings, imports their metadata, splits each
audio file into chunks, and ingests up to 20 source files per cycle. It runs
continuously, starting another cycle approximately every 10 seconds, until you
stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

```bash
cd python
uv run daemon.py
```

The daemon can import:

- Apple Voice Memos
- Google Drive Folders
- Local Audio Folders

On macOS, give your terminal application **Full Disk Access** in System Settings
if you want to import Apple Voice Memos.

**Environment variables** (optional, set in `.env`):

- `MYCELIA_APPLE_VOICEMEMOS_ROOT` - Apple Voice Memos path
- `MYCELIA_GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT` - Google Drive path
- `MYCELIA_LOCAL_AUDIO_ROOT` - Local audio folder
- `MYCELIA_GOOGLE_TZ` / `MYCELIA_LOCAL_TZ` - Timezones (default: UTC)

#### Daemon Options

| Option               | Purpose                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--once`             | Run one cycle and exit instead of watching continuously.            |
| `--reset-errors`     | Clear cached source-file ingestion errors before importing again.   |
| `--vad-only`         | Skip discovery/import and process only chunks without VAD metadata. |
| `--vad-limit N`      | Process at most `N` chunks per VAD cycle; default is `1000`.        |
| `--vad-batch-size N` | Fetch `N` chunks per VAD database batch; default is `100`.          |

`--reset-errors` cannot be combined with `--vad-only`. Both VAD numeric options
must be greater than zero.

Examples:

```bash
# Import one batch and exit
uv run daemon.py --once

# Retry source files with cached ingestion errors
uv run daemon.py --reset-errors
```

#### Run the Complete Automatic Pipeline

The recommended end-to-end command is:

```bash
cd /path/to/mycelia
./scripts/run-audio-pipeline.sh
```

It starts the Docker services and then runs local discovery/import on the host,
where Apple Voice Memos and other local files are accessible. After each audio
chunk is inserted, the backend automatically runs the remaining stages:

```text
daemon import -> VAD -> speech sequence creation -> remote STT -> conversations
```

Configure one or more transcription routes on the dedicated **Settings ->
Speech-to-text** page. Each provider has an OpenAI-compatible base URL, API key,
model, enabled switch, priority, and parallel slot count. Lower priority numbers
are selected first; providers with the same priority are load-balanced, and
lower-priority routes receive overflow when earlier routes are full. A job keeps
its selected provider snapshot even if routing is edited later.

The dedicated `STT_SERVER_URL`, `PROXY_API_KEY`, and optional `STT_MODEL`
variables from `.env` appear as the **Backend environment STT route**. Enable
that route in the same settings card if it should run alongside UI-managed local
or remote providers. Its secret remains environment-managed.

For a local Argmax server on port 10301, use `http://host.docker.internal:10301`
in the Mycelia UI. Test it directly from the Mac before adding it:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:10301/health
curl -fsS \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer local-no-auth' \
  -F 'file=@test.wav;type=audio/wav' \
  -F 'model=large-v3-v20240930_626MB' \
  -F 'response_format=verbose_json' \
  http://127.0.0.1:10301/v1/audio/transcriptions | jq .
```

Argmax does not validate this placeholder bearer token, but Mycelia requires a
non-empty profile key. See
[Local STT with Argmax and Whisper](docs/LOCAL_STT.md) for startup, Docker
networking, and model-specific examples.

### Local speaker diarization (Docker)

Argmax and the Mycelia diarizator are separate providers. `argmax-cli serve`
exposes WhisperKit transcription only. `argmax-cli diarize --audio-path ...` is
a one-shot Apple Silicon CLI that writes diarization output for one file; it
does not expose Mycelia's required `/health`, `/diarize`, and `/embed` HTTP
endpoints or the compatible Pyannote/WeSpeaker embedding space.

Run the supported local diarization service in the main Mycelia Compose project:

```bash
cd /path/to/mycelia

# First start, or after changing the Dockerfile/dependencies:
docker compose --profile diarization up -d --build diarizator

# Normal subsequent start:
docker compose --profile diarization up -d diarizator

docker compose --profile diarization ps diarizator
docker compose --profile diarization logs -f diarizator
```

Set `HF_TOKEN` in the repository `.env` and accept access to both gated models
listed in [`diarizator/README.md`](diarizator/README.md). Inside the Mycelia
network the service URL is:

```dotenv
DIARIZATION_SERVER_URL=http://diarizator:8085
```

Verify model readiness and a real audio request, not only container state:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8085/health | jq .
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8085/ready | jq .
curl -fsS \
  -F 'file=@test.wav;type=audio/wav' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8085/diarize?min_speakers=1&max_speakers=2' \
  | jq '{segments: (.segments | length), speakers: [.segments[].speaker] | unique}'
```

`/health` is liveness and reports effective batching plus inference concurrency.
`/ready` becomes HTTP 200 only after the requested compute device and both
models are ready. Each diarizator process runs one inference at a time; Mycelia
provider `Slots` must therefore remain `1` per process.

In **Settings → Diarization**, enable the environment route, set it to the
highest preference (for example priority `1`), and confirm that it reports
**Running**. See [`diarizator/README.md`](diarizator/README.md) for memory,
remote GPU, and troubleshooting details.

Turning a diarization route off blocks new jobs from that server. A request
already in flight may finish, but the active batch checks the saved route before
each following sequence and stops before making another request. The route
toggle does not stop the diarizator container or remote server process.

When historical diarization work exists, the automatic trigger treats the
pending check as a boolean and immediately fills every free healthy provider
slot. A six-route pool therefore starts up to six independent jobs without a
five-minute one-at-a-time ramp.

Historical workers take an expiring recording-level lease before hydrating
audio. Set `DIARIZATION_PREFETCH_SEQUENCES=1` only after the lease metrics show
low contention; it keeps exactly one decoded lookahead WAV and never overlaps
provider POST requests within a job.

#### Debugging conversation re-extraction

The scripts in `scripts/debug/` find and optionally enqueue historical
conversation chunks that need the v2 extractor. Finding records only prints a
tab-separated preview and never creates a JSONL file automatically:

```bash
./scripts/debug/find-conversations.sh
```

Create a JSONL input only when explicitly requested, then review it and pass
that exact file to the enqueue script. Start with `--dry-run` before enqueueing
jobs:

```bash
./scripts/debug/find-conversations.sh --write-json /tmp/conversations.jsonl
./scripts/debug/enqueue-conversations.sh --input /tmp/conversations.jsonl --dry-run
./scripts/debug/enqueue-conversations.sh --input /tmp/conversations.jsonl
```

Both scripts use `.env` OAuth credentials for enqueueing; do not commit an
exported JSONL file or credentials.

LLM routing is configured separately in **Settings -> Inference**. Choose a
default model for new memory chats independently from the preset's background
task default, optionally override summaries, conversation extraction, or
tagging, and choose the failure policy for each feature: **Stop with error** or
retry once with a specific fallback model. The same provider settings can be
supplied with `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, and
`OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` in `.env`. Per-feature fallback defaults are
`SUMMARIZATION_FALLBACK_MODEL`, `CONVERSATION_EXTRACTION_FALLBACK_MODEL`, and
`TAGGER_FALLBACK_MODEL`; leave them unset to stop on error. Streaming chat never
switches models silently.

Before running it, configure at least:

```dotenv
STT_SERVER_URL=http://gpu-host.example:8001
PROXY_API_KEY=your-proxy-key
STT_MODEL=whisper
```

Use the `whisper` alias when the Portainer stack should use whichever
`ASR_MODEL` it has loaded. The service reports the actual model, and Mycelia
stores it in `transcriptions.metadata.model`.

### Change the Whisper model in Portainer

The model shown in **Settings -> Speech-to-text -> Selected server** is the
model name Mycelia sends for request validation. It does not load a model into
the GPU. The model that is actually loaded is controlled by `ASR_MODEL` in the
Portainer stack and is loaded when the Whisper container starts.

Whisper's internal VAD filter is controlled by the single stack variable
`WHISPER_VAD_FILTER` (default `true` in the GPU compose files). When enabled,
the proxy passes `vad_filter=true` to Whisper and records the effective value in
`transcriptions.metadata.whisperVadFilter`. Set it to `false` and redeploy the
proxy if this filtering should be disabled. The status endpoint exposes the
current value as `whisperVadFilter`.

To change it, for example to `large-v3-turbo`:

1. Open Portainer -> **Stacks -> mycelia-stt -> Editor**.
2. Set `ASR_MODEL` to `large-v3-turbo` in the stack environment variables. Make
   sure the Whisper and proxy services use the same value. If the compose file
   contains a literal `ASR_MODEL`, remove or update any old Portainer stack
   variable that could override it.

   In the repository's `gpu/docker-compose.portainer.yml`, the two service
   entries use `${ASR_MODEL:-large-v3-turbo}`. They are references to one
   Portainer variable, not three independent settings, so normally you change
   only the `ASR_MODEL` value under **Environment variables**.
3. Choose **Update the stack** and confirm the redeploy. Both
   `mycelia-stt-whisper-1` and `mycelia-stt-proxy-1` must be recreated.
4. In Portainer, inspect both containers and confirm their environment has
   `ASR_MODEL=large-v3-turbo`. `running` alone is not enough.
5. From a machine that can reach the STT host, verify the proxy advertises the
   loaded model:

   ```bash
   curl --fail-with-body \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY" \
     http://gpu-host.example:8001/v1/models
   ```

   The response must contain `large-v3-turbo` in `data[].id`.
6. Back in Mycelia, press **Load STT models**, select `large-v3-turbo`, and
   press **Save STT route**. This keeps request validation and provenance
   aligned with the model actually loaded remotely.

If Mycelia shows `large-v3` while `/v1/models` returns `large-v3-turbo`, the GPU
is using Turbo and only Mycelia's saved request setting is stale. If
`/v1/models` returns `502 Bad gateway`, update the proxy image first; an old
proxy image sends that endpoint to its obsolete Ollama catch-all route.

To audit or correct old transcription provenance, use the safe dry-run script
from `python/`:

```bash
uv run debug/repair_transcription_model_provenance.py
```

It only matches `metadata.model=large-v3` records produced by the remote STT
provider and prints a sample. Apply the correction only after confirming that
those historical requests were really processed by Turbo:

```bash
uv run debug/repair_transcription_model_provenance.py \
  --apply --confirm-turbo
```

The script records the old and new values in `metadata.modelCorrection`. Do not
rewrite every `large-v3` record blindly: records made while the GPU really had
the non-Turbo model should retain their original provenance. Use `--start-after`
and `--start-before` to bound the repair when only a known time window was
processed by Turbo.

The normal `daemon.py` process performs discovery, ingestion, and device-info
backfill only. It does not calculate VAD. After a chunk is inserted, the backend
change-stream trigger creates a `vad` job, and `python-worker` runs the shared
Silero implementation from `python/jobs/vad.py`. This queued path records job
state and progress in the Jobs UI and is the normal production path.

`daemon.py --vad-only` calls that same Python VAD implementation directly while
bypassing the backend job queue. It does not create a Jobs UI record and is
intended only for recovery or manual backfills when the automatic queue is
unavailable or blocked. `stt.py` is likewise a direct recovery tool. Do not run
direct VAD or STT alongside a healthy automatic pipeline: the direct processes
can select work that the queued pipeline is also processing.

#### Run Import and VAD in Parallel

Use this recovery path only when the backend job queue is unavailable or
blocked. Keep file discovery/import on the host so it can access your local
recordings, and run VAD in the Python worker container where the Silero model
and cache are already available.

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd /path/to/mycelia/python
uv run daemon.py
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd /path/to/mycelia
docker compose exec python-worker python daemon.py --vad-only
```

For a bounded VAD run:

```bash
docker compose exec python-worker python daemon.py \
  --vad-only \
  --once \
  --vad-limit 1000 \
  --vad-batch-size 100
```

This is process-level parallelism: importing and VAD can run simultaneously. Do
not start multiple VAD-only processes against the same database, or combine one
with an active queued VAD worker. Direct VAD selects chunks with no VAD metadata
but does not claim them, so concurrent workers can process the same chunks.

After VAD marks speech chunks, inspect and run the direct STT worker only if the
automatic transcription queue is not running:

```bash
docker compose exec -T python-worker python stt.py --count
docker compose exec python-worker python stt.py
```

The host daemon log is written to `~/Library/mycelia/logs/daemon.log`.

### Configuration

When you first open the frontend, you'll be guided through a setup wizard:

1. **Server Connection** (`/setup`) - Connects to the backend and automatically
   creates your first API key.

2. **Inference Provider** (`/setup/inference`) - Configure an OpenAI-compatible
   endpoint and initial model. Settings → Inference then lets you separate the
   default for new memory chats from background-task routing. Local GPU stacks
   are supported; see [GPU README](gpu/README.md).

You can reconfigure these settings anytime in Settings.

#### Managing API Keys

- **Via Settings UI**: Go to Settings → API Keys to create, view, and revoke
  keys
- **Via Terminal** (for initial setup or automation):
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm backend deno run -A server.ts token-create
  ```
