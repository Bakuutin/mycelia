    Parse this transcript into one, zero, or more distinct conversations. 
    If there is no conversation, return an empty list.
    
    For each conversation:
    - Give it a descriptive title
    - Write a brief summary 
    - Extract key entities (people, places, things mentioned)
    - Identify start and end time

    ignore random utterances that are not part of any meaningful conversation. if it's unclear what the speakers are saying, ignore it.

    All responses must be in English language.
