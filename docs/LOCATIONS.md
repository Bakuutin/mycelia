# Location Tracks

Import GPS tracks from navigation apps (Organic Maps and anything else that
exports GPX/KML/KMZ), see where you were on the timeline and on a dedicated map,
and let Mycelia derive timezone periods from your movements so timeline times
are always displayed correctly.

## First-time setup

1. **Download the places database** (one time, ~13 MB). Open **Settings → Maps →
   Download database** (live progress bar), or click **"Download places
   database"** on the Map page. This loads the offline GeoNames cities dataset
   (~235k cities) into MongoDB — reverse geocoding then works fully offline, no
   coordinates ever leave your server.
2. **Export a track from your navigation app.**
   - _Organic Maps / CoMaps_: open Bookmarks & Tracks → share/export. Keep both
     **GPX** and **KMZ** when available: GPX is a useful independent archive;
     KMZ carries richer localized names, categories, styles and saved-place
     metadata. They can be imported in either order without duplicating the GPS
     path.
   - Any other app that produces GPX 1.1 track files (`<trkpt>` with `<time>`)
     or KML `gx:Track` works too.
3. **Import** on the **Map** page: click **Import tracks** and drop the files in
   (or use the file picker). Mycelia analyzes each file without changing the
   timeline, shows new/matched/conflicting data and the existing source files,
   then waits for explicit confirmation.
4. **Enable the Locations track** on the timeline: Timeline → layers button
   (Track visibility) → toggle **Locations**. The track is off by default and
   performs zero requests until enabled. After your first successful import it
   is enabled automatically.

## What appears where

### Timeline: the Locations track

A dedicated row on the timeline shows where you were:

- **Colored bands** — stays (same city ⇒ same color, city label when the band is
  wide enough). Purple bands are manual assignments.
- **Thin blue ribbons** — movement between stays.
- **Grey hatched bands** — gaps: no data, the route between the surrounding
  points is _assumed_.

Click any band to open a mini-map below the timeline showing where that was,
with the place name and timezone. Selecting an object marker (a conversation,
event, …) shows the same mini-map for the moment it happened.

### Map page (`/map`)

The Map has one shared selected period for presence, routes and conversations:

- Presets (Day / Week / Month / Year / All) and the compact navigator update the
  shared `start`/`end` range. Dragging a handle changes only a draft range and
  commits once on release. Clicking a density bucket sets `at`; Mycelia flies to
  a confirmed stay/manual position or accepted point inside a move. A gap shows
  **No GPS near this time** and never invents a coordinate.
- Exact links persist `start`, `end`, `lat`, `lng`, `z`, optional `at` and the
  selected `layers`. A valid saved viewport wins over automatic fitting;
  back/forward and reload restore it. **Fit selected data** is the explicit way
  to recalculate the viewport after changing the period.
- The bottom layer bar controls **Presence**, **Conversations**, **Routes**,
  **Unrecorded connections** and **Source tracks**. Conversations and Routes are
  on by default; unrecorded connectors and raw source tracks are off. Changing a
  layer never resets the viewport.
- At far zoom, **Presence** circles aggregate dwell overlap and visit count;
  their size and brightness do not depend on GPS sampling frequency. At zoom 14
  and closer, individual stay/manual circles replace the aggregate.
- 💬 **Conversation** badges use exact persistent counts. Clicking a spatial
  cluster zooms to its bounds; at maximum zoom or coincident coordinates a panel
  opens with 20 location groups per page and then 20 conversations per page. The
  map does not scan the raw objects collection. During the first index build it
  shows **Preparing map index**; a refresh keeps the previous markers dimmed
  until the new revision arrives.
- Blue **Routes** are continuity-aware fragments from the complete normalized
  source geometry. Zoom below 14 uses a light overview; zoom 14 and above
  requests buffered viewport detail simplified to at most 0.75 screen pixel. If
  the 50,000-coordinate detail budget is exceeded, the overview remains visible
  and the UI says **Zoom in for full detail**.
- Explicit GPX/KML segment boundaries, reverse/non-increasing time, pauses over
  30 minutes, teleports over 500 km and locally sparse jumps split a route.
  Hidden-by-default dashed **Unrecorded connections** can show those breaks.
  Independent sources are never joined by a common timestamp sort.
- Simultaneous independent tracks separated by more than 20 km for at least five
  minutes remain separate and appear in Review. Choose either source or keep
  both; the decision is audited and raw geometry is not deleted.
- **Saved places** — bookmarks from GPX/KML/KMZ with source names,
  localized variants, descriptions, categories, color/icon metadata and the time
  the bookmark was saved. A bookmark timestamp is never interpreted as proof
  that you were at that coordinate.
- **Recorded tracks** (toggle) — source track/route geometry with its original
  name, color and width. This is the optional raw source layer; the main Routes
  layer uses the continuity projection. Every source coordinate (timestamped or
  untimed, including elevation) remains available in normalized geometry chunks.
  Untimed `LineString`/GPX routes are map-only and never generate stays or
  timezone periods.
- **Import tracks** button — preview/confirm import with a durable receipt:
  source size/hash/parser, the selected KML member, new and matched GPS points,
  repeated items inside the file, track kinds and coordinate counts, saved
  places, styles, invalid/unpaired records and review items. Expand **File
  details** under a previous import to see the complete passport and preserved
  dataset metadata.
- **Review conflicts** appears when two source files contain different
  coordinate sets at the same timestamp or disagree on typed names,
  descriptions, categories, styles or other canonical metadata. Coordinate
  candidates remain outside processing until selected; metadata can keep the
  existing value, use the incoming value or stay deferred.

### Conversation details

If location data overlaps a conversation's time range, its detail page shows a
**Location** section: a mini-map plus "This happened in _City, Country_". The
**Use detected location** button copies the coordinates into the object's
latitude/longitude fields.

## Timezones

Every stay is resolved to an IANA timezone offline (`tz-lookup`). The processing
worker maintains `timeline_timezone_periods` records with `source: "import"`;
the timeline's contextual timezone mode picks them up automatically, so times
are rendered in the zone you were actually in. Manually created timezone periods
always win — imported periods are clipped around them, never overwrite them.

## Managing geotags

Every segment (geotag) knows where it came from: import file(s) or a manual
assignment — shown as source chips everywhere.

- **Timeline**: click a Locations band → the panel below shows the place,
  timezone and source, with **details** (ⓘ), **edit** (✎) and, inside the
  details card, **Delete / Override / Open in map**.
- **Map page → Geotags** button: the full list for the current period with type
  filter, source chips, overlap warnings, and per-row actions (show on map,
  details, edit, delete).
- **Deleting** a manual geotag removes the assignment (derived data reappears).
  Deleting a _derived_ geotag permanently deletes the GPS points behind it —
  re-importing the same file will not restore them (they stay deduplicated
  away). Deleting a whole import (Settings → Maps or the import dialog) removes
  that source and its metadata links; a canonical GPS point is deleted only when
  no other committed import references it.
- **Duplicates / overlapping tracks**: exact timestamp+coordinate matches gain
  another provenance link instead of another canonical point. Partial overlap
  imports only the unambiguous additions. Different coordinate sets at one
  timestamp are retained in a review queue and excluded from processing until
  explicitly selected. Multiple coordinates at one timestamp are valid when the
  complete source sets match. A manual assignment always wins: all derived
  segments (stays, moves and gaps) are clipped around it.

## Settings → Maps

One place for everything geo: GeoNames status (count, last update) with a
live-progress download/update button, the list of track imports with delete, the
tile-server URL (point it at your own server for fully offline maps), a toggle
for the timeline Locations track, and a full-reprocess button.

## Manual locations

When there is no GPS data (or it is wrong), assign a location by hand:

- **Timeline**: select a range on the time axis → **Location** (📍) action in
  the toolbar.
- **Map**: click a grey assumed-route line.

In the dialog, search a city by name (offline GeoNames autocomplete) or click
the exact spot on the embedded map, adjust the range if needed, and save. This
creates a manual location segment **and** a matching manual timezone period, and
re-clips the assumed gaps around it. Manual segments can be deleted from the API
(`location.delete-segment`); deleting restores the derived gap.

## How processing works

- Import is a staged saga: `/api/location/imports/analyze` parses and stages the
  source without timeline writes; `/api/location/imports/:previewId/confirm`
  rechecks the database revision and commits idempotently. Newly-owned points
  remain invisible until every batch and metadata entity is durable.
- Canonical observations live in `location_points`, with `importIds[]` and
  source references. `location_tracks` stores typed recorded tracks/routes;
  `location_track_geometry` stores complete ordered geometry in bounded chunks;
  `location_bookmarks` stores saved places; `location_point_conflicts` stores
  deferred coordinate candidates; and `location_metadata_conflicts` stores
  field-level review decisions. A small `renderPath` is only a map preview and
  is never presented as the full source route.
- Typed metadata keeps normalized fields plus the complete non-geometry source
  subtree in `rawMetadata`, folder hierarchy and one source reference per
  occurrence. GPX and KMZ can be imported in either order: geometry is matched
  rather than duplicated, while the higher-priority KML/KMZ semantics enrich the
  canonical track or saved place. Manual choices remain authoritative.
- The `location_processing` worker (triggered automatically after each import)
  segments points into **stays** (≥10 min within ~200 m), **moves**
  (Douglas-Peucker-simplified paths) and **gaps** (>30 min silences), reverse
  geocodes stays against GeoNames, and derives timezone periods.
- Everything derived is rebuilt idempotently per time window — re-importing or
  deleting an import re-generates segments for the affected period only.
- `locationMapProjection` is a separate controlled Jobs worker. It publishes
  atomic generations of conversation placement and source-aware route fragments;
  migrations only create the empty collections and indexes. Subsequent object,
  segment and track changes are coalesced through durable pending/dirty state.
- Parser/content profile v3 retains GPX `trkseg`, KML `gx:Track` and
  `gx:MultiTrack` child boundaries plus source point order. During rollout,
  reparsing committed originals enriches old full geometry; missing originals
  are marked incomplete rather than reconstructed from a reduced preview.

## Limits and notes

- KML `LineString`, untimed GPX geometry and valid `gx:coord` values without a
  matching timestamp cannot be placed on the timeline, but they are retained in
  full as map geometry rather than discarded. A partially timed route is labeled
  `mixed`. Extra timestamps without coordinates, invalid values and unsupported
  geometry types are counted separately in the file passport.
- Map tiles are fetched from openstreetmap.org. For heavy use or full offline
  operation, point the tile URL in
  `frontend/src/components/location/LocationMap.tsx` at your own tile server.
- Place labels appear only after the GeoNames database is downloaded; stays
  imported earlier are labeled automatically once it is.
